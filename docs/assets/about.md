# About This Page

This project was created to demonstrate a common pattern in web development: creating a static site that can display rich content from simple text files.

### Technologies Used

*   **HTML5**: For the basic structure.
*   **CSS3**: For styling and layout (using Flexbox).
*   **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For all the dynamic functionality.
*   **[Marked.js](https://marked.js.org/)**: A fast, lightweight library for parsing Markdown.

There is no backend server required. This entire page can be hosted on any static site hosting service like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.
