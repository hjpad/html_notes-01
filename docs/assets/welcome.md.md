# Welcome to the Markdown Viewer!

This is a simple single-page application that demonstrates how to:

1.  List files from a directory.
2.  Fetch a selected file's content.
3.  Parse Markdown into HTML.
4.  Display the result in the main view.

**Click on a file in the sidebar to get started!**

> This project uses the `marked.js` library to handle Markdown parsing on the client-side.
